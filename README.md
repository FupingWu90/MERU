# MERU
This code is for the semi-supervised learning method in [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9921323).

# Usage

## For ACDC dataset 
The code in file 'ACDC2017/MERU' is the training and testing script with five-fold cross-validation.

For reproduction, please set your own datapath:
--datapath : set your ACDC '--datapath' argument in ACDC2017/MERU/Sup_main.py 

## to do
Codes of compared methods (such as Co-Training, mean-teacher) with the same framework would be released in the future.....
